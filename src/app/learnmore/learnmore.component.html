    <h1>Detail about Tajmahal</h1>
    <p>
    The Taj Mahal is considered to be the greatest architectural achievement in the whole range of Indo-Islamic architecture.
     Its recognised architectonic beauty has a rhythmic combination of solids and voids, concave and convex and light shadow; 
     such as arches and domes further increases the aesthetic aspect. The colour combination of lush green scape reddish pathway and blue 
     sky over it show cases the monument in ever changing tints and moods. The relief work in marble and inlay with precious and semi
      precious stones make it a monument apart. </p>

        <p>
            The uniqueness of Taj Mahal lies in some truly remarkable innovations carried out by the horticulture planners and architects
             of Shah Jahan. One such genius planning is the placing of tomb at one end of the quadripartite garden rather than in the exact 
             centre, which added rich depth and perspective to the distant view of the monument. It is also, one of the best examples of raised 
             tomb variety. The tomb is further raised on a square platform with the four sides of the octagonal base of the minarets extended 
             beyond the square at the corners. The top of the platform is reached through a lateral flight of steps provided in the centre of the
              southern side. The ground plan of the Taj Mahal is in perfect balance of composition, the octagonal tomb chamber in the centre, 
              encompassed by the portal halls and the four corner rooms. The plan is repeated on the upper floor. The exterior of the tomb is 
              square in plan, with chamfered corners. The large double storied domed chamber, which houses the cenotaphs of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah 
              Jahan, is a perfect octagon in plan. The exquisite octagonal marble lattice screen encircling both cenotaphs is a piece of superb 
              workmanship. It is highly polished and richly decorated with inlay work. The borders of the frames are inlaid with precious stones 
              representing flowers executed with wonderful perfection. The hues and the shades of the stones used to make the leaves and the flowers 
              appear almost real. The cenotaph of Mumtaz Mahal is in perfect centre of the tomb chamber, placed on a rectangular platform decorated
               with inlaid flower plant motifs. The cenotaph of Shah Jahan is greater than Mumtaz Mahal and installed more than thirty years later by
                the side of the latter on its west. The upper cenotaphs are only illusory and the real graves are in the lower tomb chamber (crypt), 
                a practice adopted in the imperial Mughal tombs.
                <br>
            </p>

The four free-standing minarets at the corners of the platform added a hitherto unknown dimension to the Mughal architecture. The four
 minarets provide not only a kind of spatial reference to the monument but also give a three dimensional effect to the edifice.,

    <h1>Detail about Red Fort</h1>
    <p>The Red Fort was the site of a terrorist attack on 22 December 2000, carried out by six Lashkar-e-Taiba members. 
        Two soldiers and a civilian were killed in what the news media described as an attempt to derail India-Pakistan
         peace talks.[44][45]

        In April 2018, Dalmia Bharat Group adopted the Red Fort for maintenance, development, and operations, per a 
        contract worth ₹25 crores for a period of five years, under the government's "Adopt A Heritage" scheme.[46] The memorandum of understanding was signed with the ministries of Tourism and Culture, and the 
        Archaeological Survey of India (A.S.I.).[47] The adoption of the fort by a private group left people divided and drew criticism from the public, opposition political parties, and historians. It also led to the #IndiaOnSale hashtag on Twitter.[48] In May 2018, the Indian History Congress called for the deal to be suspended until there is an "impartial review" of the deal "by the Central
         Advisory Board of Archaeology or any other recognised body of experts".[49]</p>

        <h1>Details about Charminar</h1>
        <p>The Charminar was constructed at the intersection of the historical trade route that connects the city to international markets through the port city of Machilipatnam.[13]:195 The Old City of Hyderabad was designed with Charminar as its centrepiece.[14] The city was spread around the Charminar in four different quadrants and chambers, segregated according to the established settlements. Towards the north of Charminar is the Char Kaman, or four gateways, constructed in the cardinal direction.[10][13][15][16]:170 Additional eminent architects from Persia were also invited to develop the city plan. The structure itself was 
            intended to serve as a mosque and madrasa. It is of Indo-Islamic architecture style, incorporating Persian architectural elements.</p>

           <p>The monument overlooks another grand mosque called the Makkah Masjid. Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, the 5th ruler of the Qutb Shahi
                dynasty, commissioned bricks to be made from the soil brought from Mecca, the holiest site of Islam,
                and used them in the construction of the central arch of the mosque, hence its name.</p>
